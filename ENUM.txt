//public static final constats:
public class Direction {
	public static final Direction UP = new Direction();   // static -> only one instance of that in the class, it belongs to a type itself(Direction)
	public static final Direction DOWN = new Direction() // final -> there is only one way to access it, if we don't change the reference of an object
	public static final Direction RIGHT = new Direction();
	public static final Direction LEFT = new Direction();
}

	//This requires a constructor:	
	//public Direction(){}))
	

the following compact and easy code is equivalent to the above:

public enum Direction {
	UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT;
}

//The default constructor is made by the compiler automatically when the programmer doesn't write another one.))
